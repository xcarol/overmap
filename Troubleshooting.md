xcarol: flutter doctor throws this error:
Error: Unable to run "adb", check your Android SDK installation and ANDROID_HOME
      environment variable: /home/xcarol/workspace/android-sdk/platform-tools/adb
he comprovat la variable d'entorn ANDROID_HOME:
echo $ANDROID_HOME i retorna:
/home/xcarol/workspace/android-sdk
he executat /home/xcarol/workspace/android-sdk/platform-tools/adb i apareix l'ajuda del adb.

VS Code: It seems like your `adb` is correctly installed and the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable is set properly. However, Visual Studio Code might not be picking up the environment variable. To resolve this, you can try the following steps:

1. **Add `ANDROID_HOME` to Visual Studio Code settings**:
   Add the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable to your Visual Studio Code settings to ensure it is recognized.

```json
{
  "terminal.integrated.env.linux": {
    "ANDROID_HOME": "/home/xcarol/workspace/android-sdk"
  }
}
```

2. **Restart Visual Studio Code**:
   After adding the environment variable to the settings, restart Visual Studio Code to apply the changes.

3. **Verify the environment variable in the terminal**:
   Open a new integrated terminal in Visual Studio Code and verify that the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable is set correctly by running:
   
```bash
   echo $ANDROID_HOME
   ```
4. **Run `flutter doctor` again**:
   After verifying the environment variable, run `flutter doctor` again to check if the issue is resolved:
   
```bash
   flutter doctor
   ```
If the issue persists, you might want to check if there are any additional environment variables or paths that need to be set for `adb` to work correctly.

xcarol: it seems dart daemon is failling. current file are the daemon logs.

```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
```

2. **Verify `adb` devices**:
   Run the following command to check if your device is recognized by `adb`:

```bash
adb devices
```

   Ensure that your device appears in the list of connected devices.

3. **Restart the Dart and Flutter daemons**:
   Sometimes, restarting the daemons can help resolve issues. You can do this by running:

```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

4. **Check for additional logs**:
   Look for any additional error messages or logs that might provide more information about the issue.

5. **Update Flutter and Dart SDKs**:
   Ensure that you are using the latest versions of Flutter and Dart SDKs. You can update them by running:

```bash
flutter upgrade
```

6. **Reinstall the Dart and Flutter extensions**:
   Try reinstalling the Dart and Flutter extensions in Visual Studio Code to ensure they are correctly configured.

If the issue persists, please provide more details or additional logs that might help diagnose the problem further.

xcarol: when I run sdb devices it throws this error:
01-09 17:54:00.002 161292 161292 E adb     : usb_libusb.cpp:571 failed to open device: Access denied (insufficient permissions)

GitHub Copilot: The error message indicates that `adb` does not have the necessary permissions to access your device. This is a common issue on Linux systems. You can resolve it by setting up the necessary udev rules for your device. Here are the steps:

1. **Create a udev rules file**:
   Create a new file for the udev rules. You can name it `51-android-usb.rules` and place it in the 

rules.d

 directory.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android-usb.rules
```

2. **Add the udev rules**:
   Add the following content to the file. This example includes rules for various manufacturers. You may need to add specific rules for your device's manufacturer.

```plaintext
# Google
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="18d1", MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev"
# Samsung
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="04e8", MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev"
# HTC
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="0bb4", MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev"
# Sony Ericsson
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="0fce", MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev"
# LG
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="1004", MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev"
# Motorola
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="22b8", MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev"
# Huawei
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="12d1", MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev"
# ZTE
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="19d2", MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev"
# Nvidia
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="0955", MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev"
# Amazon
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="1949", MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev"
```

3. **Reload udev rules**:
   After saving the file, reload the udev rules to apply the changes.

```bash
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger
```

4. **Restart the adb server**:
   Restart the adb server to ensure it picks up the new permissions.

```bash
adb kill-server
adb start-server
```

5. **Check connected devices**:
   Finally, check if your device is recognized by `adb`.

```bash
adb devices
```

This should resolve the permission issue and allow `adb` to access your device. If the problem persists, ensure that your user is part of the `plugdev` group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG plugdev $USER
```

Then, log out and log back in for the group changes to take effect.

xcarol: When I try to debug the app these logs appear in the debug console:
adb: failed to install /home/xcarol/workspace/overmaps/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk: Failure [INSTALL_FAILED_USER_RESTRICTED: Install canceled by user]
Error launching application on 2312DRA50G.

GitHub Copilot: The error `INSTALL_FAILED_USER_RESTRICTED: Install canceled by user` indicates that the installation of the APK was canceled by the device's user or restricted by the device's settings. Here are a few steps to resolve this issue:

1. **Check Device Settings**:
   Ensure that your device allows installations from unknown sources. This setting is usually found under `Settings > Security > Install unknown apps`.

2. **Enable Developer Options**:
   Make sure that Developer Options are enabled on your device. Go to `Settings > About phone` and tap on the `Build number` seven times to enable Developer Options. Then, go to `Settings > Developer options` and ensure that `USB debugging` is enabled.

3. **Revoke USB Debugging Authorizations**:
   Sometimes, revoking USB debugging authorizations and re-authorizing the computer can help. Go to `Settings > Developer options` and find the `Revoke USB debugging authorizations` option. After revoking, reconnect your device and authorize the computer again.

4. **Check for Device Management Policies**:
   If your device is managed by an organization (e.g., a work device), there might be policies in place that restrict app installations. Check with your IT department or device administrator.

5. **Restart ADB Server**:
   Restart the ADB server to ensure it is running correctly.

```bash
adb kill-server
adb start-server
```

6. **Reinstall the App**:
   Try uninstalling the existing app from your device and then reinstalling it via the debug process.

```bash
adb uninstall com.yourcompany.yourapp
```

Replace `com.yourcompany.yourapp` with your app's package name.

7. **Check for Storage Permissions**:
   Ensure that your app has the necessary storage permissions to install the APK. You can grant storage permissions manually if needed.

After performing these steps, try debugging the application again. If the issue persists, please provide more details about your device and any additional error messages you encounter.
